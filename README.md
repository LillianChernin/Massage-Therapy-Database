# The Massage Therapy Database

## Description and Motivation

A database for massage therapists and massage therapists in training to share
treatment strategies for common musculoskeletal conditions.  The main objective
is to create a resource for massage therapists so that they can provide the best
treatments possible for their clients.  Also the goal is to create a centralized
knowledge base to help massage therapists in training learn techniques and develop
a firmer understanding of the basic kinesiology and anatomy that massage techniques
are based on.
